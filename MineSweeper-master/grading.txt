Summary:
  + Strengths: 
	good team effort
	good overall design and implementation
	both command line and GUI versions
	all goals accomplished!
  - Weaknesses: 
	For grading, it really helps to know who you are (always set your name for git, Jonah hadn't set his); having multiple names is easy to avoid, too, but not a big problem
