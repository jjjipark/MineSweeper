This week we scheduled a regular meeting time for each week so that we can discuss progress and deligate tasks. 

For this week we will begin investigating 2D frameworks for creating the gui and starting to implement the game class.

The game class will be similar to the game class we are currently writing for assignment 5 where the board will be stored in a 2D array. The elements of the array will most likely be a cell class where the cell can be either empty or bomb and have three possible conditions: covered, open or flagged. Each cell will have methods to change its condition and look at its adjacent cells to know how many bombs it is touching.
